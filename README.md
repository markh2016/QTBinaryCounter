The above project is designed to work with  udp client as part of an experiment  to see how to communicate with a 
client interfaced with arduino 
It works quite well how ever it is not completely reliable in delivery of messages  as you'd expect with UDP 
A good starting point though with  network  programming interfaced to the real world 
Enjoy
